# Customize Vue Tree Grid Rows Using a Template

A quick-start project that shows you how to customize the Vue TreeGrid rows using a template. The rowTemplate property accepts either string or HTML element ID values, which are then used as the template for the row. In this project, we present employee information with a photo and details like name, address, etc.

Refer to the following documentation on the row template in the Syncfusion Vue Tree Grid component:
