# customize-vue-tree-grid-rows-using-a-template
A quick-start project that shows you how to customize the Vue TreeGrid rows using a template. The rowTemplate property accepts either string or HTML element ID values, which are then used as the template for the row. In this project, we present employee information with a photo and details like name, address, etc.
